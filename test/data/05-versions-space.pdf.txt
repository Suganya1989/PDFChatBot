language,  and  folk  tales  have  been  part  of  the  oral  tradition  in  every  
culture.  This  oral  tradition  makes  use  of  repeated  sentence  patterns  
to  enhance  listeners‚Äô  understanding  of  the  story.
The Little Red Hen and Other Folk Tales  is  an  anthology  of  
delightful  tales  drawn  from  the  literature  of  England,  Russia,  
America,  and  the  Far  East.  The  stories  are  written  with  predictable,  
repetitive  language  patterns  that  encourage  the  participation  of  the  
young  child.  Emergent  readers  draw  upon  their  own  oral  language  
and  prior  knowledge  to  anticipate  each  story‚Äôs  development.

their formative years.

Introduction
Children  around  the  world  love  to  hear  folk  tales,  and  
parents  and  grandparents  love  to  tell  them.  Folk  tales  are  
very  old  stories  that  have  been  passed  down  from  great-
grandparents  to  grandparents,  from  grandparents  to  parents,  
and  from  parents  to  children,  for  hundreds  of  years!
People  keep  telling  these  stories  year  after  year  because  they  
help  us  learn  about  ourselves.  As  you  read,  think  about  the  
story.  It  might  make  you  think  about  your  own  life.
Try  this:  After  reading  the  English  folk  tale  ‚ÄúThe  Little  Red  
Hen,‚Äù ask yourself, ‚ÄúWhat would I have done if I were the 
Little  Red  Hen?  Would  I  have  shared  with  my  friends  even    
if they hadn‚Äôt helped me?‚Äù Talk about your ideas with  
your  friends,  parents,  or  teacher.  Always  respect  each  
person‚Äôs  point  of  view.  Remember,  there  are  no  right  or  
wrong  answers.
The  folk  tales  in  this  book  come  from  many  countries.    
When  you  read  them,  you  will  learn  about  traditions  and

can  help  you  learn  about  yourself,  other  books  that  you‚Äôve

Editor‚Äôs Notes on Folk Tales
We selected the stories in this collection to represent the familiar and 
WKHH[RWLFWKHYHU\ROGDQGWKHEUDQGQHZLQVKRUWWRHQFDSVXODWH
the best qualities of the folk tale genre. Tied to oral language, folk 
tales readily bend, evolve, and are born to suit their times and 
audiences.
Some of the folk tales in this book have been edited for brevity or

discovering wheat, followed by any combination of the following:

Bhutan is a far-eastern country located in the Himalayan Mountains 
north of India. ‚ÄúThe Four Friends‚Äù is one of this country‚Äôs favorite 
folk tales. In fact, paintings of a peacock, rabbit, monkey, and 
elephant standing one on top of the other is a common appearance in 
many buildings and homes there. This story demonstrates the value
